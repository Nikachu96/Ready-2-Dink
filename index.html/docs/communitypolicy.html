<h2>Ready 2 Dink Community Guidelines</h2>
<p>
  These guidelines set the standards for behavior and sportsmanship expected of all Ready 2 Dink (R2D)
  users on and off the court. Adherence to these guidelines ensures a safe, fair, and enjoyable experience
  for everyone.
</p>

<h3>1. Sportsmanship and Respect</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Respect Opponents and Partners:</strong>
    Treat everyone with courtesy, regardless of skill level, outcome of the match, or difference in opinion.
    Verbal abuse, harassment, or derogatory comments (based on gender, race, age, religion, or background)
    are strictly prohibited.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Zero Tolerance for Abuse:</strong>
    Any language, gestures, or actions deemed threatening, intimidating, or excessively confrontational will
    result in immediate review and potential account suspension or permanent ban.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-Refereed Integrity:</strong>
    Since all matches are self-refereed, respect your opponent's calls and be honest with your own.
    The primary rule is fairness over winning. If there is doubt about a call, the point should be replayed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Fair Play and Skill Integrity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Honest Skill Rating:</strong>
    You must register and maintain an accurate skill level rating (e.g., 3.0, 4.5).
    Misrepresenting your skill to gain an unfair advantage in matchmaking or tournament entry is considered cheating.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accurate Result Reporting:</strong>
    Submit match scores accurately and honestly through the R2D app immediately following the completion of play.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Match Commitment:</strong>
    Honor your commitment to complete scheduled matches within the agreed-upon timeframe (7 days for tournaments).
    If unavoidable circumstances prevent play, communicate proactively with your opponent/partner and R2D support.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Safety and Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prioritize Safety:</strong>
    You are responsible for your physical safety and the safety of those around you.
    Do not engage in unsafe play, aggressive actions, or actions that could damage property.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Court Condition:</strong>
    Ensure the court you are playing on is safe, dry, and free of hazards before starting play.
    R2D is not responsible for the maintenance or safety of third-party facilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Equipment:</strong>
    Use safe, non-damaged, and regulation-compliant equipment.
  </li>
</ul>
